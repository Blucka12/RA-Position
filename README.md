**Research Assistant position**

Flexible student work opportunity: design, UX, user relations

**Start** as soon as possible

**Duration** through summer 2014, possibly longer

**Hours** negotiable

**Pay** $12 per hour

I (Ryan Shaw, <http://aeshin.org/>) am looking for a student to assist me with my studies of systems for organizing documents of historical significance. 

The position would be ideal for someone interested in (Web) design, user experience, and/or user relations (gathering feedback, providing documentation). 

If you have been introduced to programming and are interested in further developing your skills, this could be a good opportunity, but no programming background is required to apply.

An interest or background in history is not required but would be a plus.

**Interested applicants** should [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository, edit this document to briefly describe yourself and why you are interested in the position. Provide links supporting documentation such as resumes, portfolios, Web sites, etc. Then send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) with your changes.
