Greetings,
My name is Oak Ritchie, and I am a first year MSIS student at SILS. This position interests me because I have recently taken a programming course that has awakened a very real interest in working with code and learning of the capabilities that I can develop using the skills that I've gained in the last year. I am becoming quite familiar with Python, have interacted with Flask, am familiar with HTML and am willing to learn. I presently blog at [Steady Flow](www.steadyflowblog.com), my [github](https://github.com/Blucka12) account is quite active, and I am currently using Nitrous to work on Github from the command line. I am familiar with a professional workflow where I work from my own fork of a repository and branch different tasks to track changes and keep updates contained, and I am learning how to debug as I go along. Being a Masters student, time to serve in this capacity may well be limited, but I would very much like to learn more from May to August if I am a good fit for the position.
